            <p>
                Breaking over the hump of thirty years old. I decided it was time to pursue something I've wanted. Helping others that may not be tech savvy feel more comfortable using the web or applications. Having a small Computer Science background and exposure to animation and game development. Interacting with apps that were frustrating and coming up with other ways to display interfaces became second nature. I wanted to break the internet. Just kidding, I really just thought about ways I could help others. The importance of how we perceive information and its accessibility is vital today. Everyone should be able to enjoy the web safely.
